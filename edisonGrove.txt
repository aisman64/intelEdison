- Setting up your Edison
    - If using the Arduino Kit, you will need a 7~15V power brick, usb will probably not have enough power
    - If you are using the small breakboard kit, it should be fine using two USBs
    - Plug your Edison into the computer (Both USB Ports)
    - Run the All-in-One installer
    - Search for the COM port, it should say "USB Serial Port"
    - Connect to this port using PuTTY, baud rate 115200 
    - Login is "root", password is empty
    - Now run the command "configure_edison --setup" and set up your Edison
